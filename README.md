## Building the project

Requires Visual Studio (2022 or later).

After cloning the repo run `build_init.cmd` located in the `build` directory, this doesn't not run again unless there are updates to the tools or third party libraries.

Execute `build_release.cmd` located in the `build` directory to compile the project or load the `SystemInformer.sln` and `Plugins.sln` solutions if you prefer building the project using Visual Studio.

You can download the free [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) to build the System Informer source code.

See the [build readme](./build/README.md) for more information or if you're having trouble building.

## Enhancements/Bugs


Please use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/winsiderss/systeminformer/issues)
for reporting problems or suggesting new features.


## Settings

If you are running System Informer from a USB drive, you may want to
save System Informer's settings there as well. To do this, create a
blank file named "SystemInformer.exe.settings.xml" in the same
directory as SystemInformer.exe. You can do this using Windows Explorer:

1. Make sure "Hide extensions for known file types" is unticked in
   Tools > Folder options > View.
2. Right-click in the folder and choose New > Text Document.
3. Rename the file to SystemInformer.exe.settings.xml (delete the ".txt"
   extension).
